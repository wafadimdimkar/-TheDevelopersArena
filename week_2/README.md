Student Grade Calculator <br> 
Week 2 – Data Science Internship<br> 

 Project Overview<br> 
This project is developed as part of **Week 2 of the Data Science Internship**.<br>   
The objective of this project is to understand **decision-making and looping concepts in Python** by building a **Student Grade Calculator**.<br> 

The program takes a student’s name and marks as input, validates the input, calculates the grade using conditional statements, and displays an encouraging message based on performance.<br> 

 Project Objectives<br> 
The main objectives of this project are:<br> 

- To understand decision-making using `if-elif-else`<br> 
- To use comparison operators for logical conditions<br> 
- To apply `while` loops for input validation<br> 
- To create and use functions for reusable logic<br> 
- To handle invalid user input gracefully<br> 
- To build confidence in writing real-life Python programs<br> 
 Technologies Used<br> 

Software<br> 
- Python 3 <br>  
- Google Colab / Python IDLE  <br> 

Hardware<br> 
- CPU (Provided by Google Colab) <br>  
- Minimum 2 GB RAM <br>  

> No external Python libraries were used in this project.<br>

 Program Description<br> 
The **Student Grade Calculator** performs the following operations:<br> 

1. Takes the student name as input <br>  
2. Accepts marks between 0 and 100  <br> 
3. Validates the marks using a `while` loop  <br> 
4. Calculates the grade using `if-elif-else` conditions <br>  
5. Displays a personalized result with an encouraging message <br>  

This project simulates a real-life academic grading system.
<br> 
 Grading Logic<br> 
The grading system used in this project is:<br> 

| Marks Range | Grade |<br> 
|------------|-------|<br> 
| 90 – 100   | A     |<br> 
| 80 – 89    | B     |<br> 
| 70 – 79    | C     |<br> 
| 60 – 69    | D     |<br> 
| 0 – 59     | F     |<br> 

Code Explanation<br> 

 Input System<br> 
- `input()` is used to take student name and marks<br> 
- Marks are converted to integer for comparison<br> 

 Input Validation<br> 
- A `while` loop ensures marks are only between **0 and 100**<br> 
- User is prompted again if invalid input is entered<br> 

 Functions Used<br> 
- A function is used to calculate the grade<br> 
- Another function provides encouraging messages based on grade<br> 

 Output Display<br> 
- The result is displayed using `print()`<br> 
- Output is clear, formatted, and user-friendly<br> 

Day-Wise Work Description<br> 

 Day 1: Understanding the Grading System<br> 
- Studied grading rules<br> 
- Converted mark ranges into logical conditions<br> 
- Planned the program logic<br> 

 Day 2: Input System<br> 
- Implemented input for student name and marks<br> 
- Learned how to convert input into integers<br> 
 Day 3: Grading Logic<br> 
- Used `if-elif-else` statements<br> 
- Assigned grades based on marks<br> 
- Added encouraging messages<br> 

 Day 4: Validation & Looping<br> 
- Implemented `while` loop for input validation<br> 
- Handled invalid inputs effectively
<br> 
 Day 5: Final Program & Testing<br> 
- Combined all parts into a complete program<br> 
- Tested the program with multiple test cases<br> 
- Fixed errors and improved output formatting<br> 
- Took screenshots and prepared GitHub submission<br> 

 How to Run the Program<br> 

 Option 1: Using Google Colab<br> 
1. Open Google Colab <br>  
2. Create a new notebook <br>  
3. Copy code from `grade_calculator.py` <br>  
4. Paste and run the cell  <br> 
5. Enter student details when prompted<br>   

Option 2: Using Local System<br> 
1. Install Python 3 <br>  
2. Open terminal or command prompt<br>   
3. Navigate to the project folder<br>   
4. Run:<br> 

 Testing & Validation<br>
