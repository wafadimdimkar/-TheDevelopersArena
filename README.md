🐍 Personal Introduction Program (Python)<br>

📌 Project Overview<br>
This project is a beginner-level Python application developed as part of Week 1 – Python Basics. <br> 
The main objective of this program is to understand the fundamentals of Python programming by creating an interactive application that collects user details and displays a personalized welcome message.<br>

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Python syntax, user input, variables, and formatted output.<br>

 🎯 Project Objectives<br>
- Understand the basics of Python programming<br>
- Learn how Python executes code step by step<br>
- Use variables to store user data<br>
- Take user input using the `input()` function<br>
- Display formatted output using `print()`<br> and f-strings
- Build confidence in writing simple Python programs<br>

🛠️ Technologies Used<br>

Software<br>
- Python 3 (Google Colab Environment)<br>

Hardware<br>
- CPU provided by Google Colab<br>
- Minimum 2 GB RAM<br>

> No external libraries were used in this project.<br>

 💻 Code Explanation (personal_intro.py)<br>

Step 1: Taking User Input<br>
The program begins by asking the user basic personal questions using the `input()` function. <br> 
Each answer provided by the user is stored in a variable.<br>

Example:<br>
- Name is stored in a variable<br>
- Age is stored in a variable<br>
- Hobby is stored in a variable<br>

This demonstrates how Python interacts with users and stores data in memory.<br>

 Step 2: Using Variables<br>
Variables are used to store user-provided data such as name, age, and hobby.<br>  
These variables allow the program to reuse the information later while displaying output.<br>

 Step 3: Displaying Output<br>
The program uses `print()` along with **f-strings** to display a friendly and personalized welcome message.<br>  
F-strings help insert variable values directly into text, making the output clean and readable.<br>

 Step 4: Program Flow<br>
The program executes sequentially:<br>
1. Ask questions<br>
2. Store responses<br>
3. Display personalized message<br>

This helps in understanding how Python runs code from top to bottom.<br>

🗓️ Day-Wise Work Description<br>

 🟢 Day 1: Setup & First Program<br>
- Set up Python environment using Google Colab<br>
- Learned what programming is and how Python works<br>
- Wrote and executed the first Python program using `print()`<br>

 🟢 Day 2: Variables & User Input<br>
- Learned about variables and data storage<br>
- Used the `input()` function to collect user information<br>
- Stored name, age, and city in variables<br>

🟢 Day 3: Personalized Welcome Message<br>
- Learned about f-strings<br>
- Displayed personalized output using user inputs<br>
- Improved readability of output<br>

 🟢 Day 4: Program Enhancement<br>
- Added more user questions such as hobby<br>
- Improved output formatting<br>

- Prepared files for GitHub submission<br>

▶️ How to Run the Program<br>

 Using Google Colab<br>
1. Open Google Colab<br>
2. Create a new notebook<br>
3. Copy the code from `personal_intro.py`<br>
4. Paste it into a code cell<br>
5. Run the cell and provide inputs when prompted<br>

🧠 Concepts Learned<br>
- Python syntax basics<br>
- Variables and data storage<br>
- User input using `input()`<br>
- Output using `print()`<br>
- String formatting using f-strings<br>
- Debugging and testing simple programs<br>

🧪 Testing & Validation<br>
- Program executed successfully multiple times<br>
- Tested with different user inputs<br>
- Verified correct display of personalized messages<br>
- Screenshot included as proof of execution<br>
