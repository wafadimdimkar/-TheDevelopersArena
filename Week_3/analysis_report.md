Sales Data Analysis Report<br>  
**Week 3 – Data Science Internship**<br>
 Introduction<br>
This report presents the analysis of a sales dataset as part of **Week 3 of the Data Science Internship**. <br> 
The objective of this analysis is to explore real-world sales data, clean the dataset, calculate key sales metrics, and extract meaningful insights using Python and the pandas library.<br>
 Dataset Description<br>
- **File Name:** sales_data.csv <br> 
- **Number of Rows:** 100  <br>
- **Number of Columns:** 5  <br>

The dataset contains basic sales information such as product name, quantity, price, and total sales value.<br>

 Tools & Technologies Used<br>
- **Python 3**<br>
- **Pandas Library**<br>
- **Google Colab / Python Environment**<br>

No external libraries other than pandas were used.<br>

 Data Loading & Exploration<br>
The dataset was loaded using the pandas `read_csv()` function.<br>  
Initial exploration was performed to understand the structure of the data, including:<br>
- Viewing the first few rows of the dataset<br>
- Checking the number of rows and columns<br>
- Identifying column names and data types<br>
- Verifying the presence of missing values<br>

This step helped in understanding the overall quality of the dataset.<br>

 Data Cleaning Process<br>
To ensure accurate analysis, the following data cleaning steps were performed:<br>

- Checked for missing values in all columns<br>
- Removed rows containing missing values<br>
- Removed duplicate records from the dataset<br>

These steps helped improve data reliability and consistency.<br>

 Sales Analysis & Metrics<br>
After cleaning the data, the following key sales metrics were calculated:<br>

- **Total Revenue:** Sum of all sales values <br> 
- **Highest Sale Value:** Maximum sales value in the dataset <br> 
- **Lowest Sale Value:** Minimum sales value in the dataset <br> 
- **Best Selling Product:** Product with the highest total sales <br> 

These metrics provide a clear overview of the overall sales performance.<br>

 Key Findings<br>
- The dataset contains multiple products with varying sales values<br>
- Total revenue gives insight into overall business performance<br>
- The best-selling product contributes the most to total revenue<br>
- Highest and lowest sales values help identify performance extremes<br>

 Conclusion<br>
This sales data analysis project demonstrates how Python and pandas can be used to analyze real-world datasets.<br>  
By performing data exploration, cleaning, and analysis, meaningful insights were extracted from the data.<br>

This project strengthened my understanding of:<br>
- Working with CSV files<br>
- Data cleaning techniques<br>
- Basic statistical analysis
- Using pandas for real-world data analysis<br>

The knowledge gained in this project forms a strong foundation for advanced data analysis tasks in future weeks.<br>
